Global Mental Health Crisis Visualization

Project Overview

This project aims to visualize the global mental health crisis by analyzing and presenting data on mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression. The primary objective is to provide insights into the prevalence, trends, and correlations of mental health disorders worldwide through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

Purpose

The goal is to help HealWorld Health Insights and other stakeholders, including policymakers and healthcare providers, to:

Identify regions with high mental disorder prevalence.

Analyze trends in mental health disorders over time.

Understand correlations between different disorders.

Highlight countries where mental health conditions have increased or decreased.

Dataset Summary

The dataset used in this project consists of global mental health disorder statistics, including:

Entity: Country or region name.

Year: The year of data collection.

Schizophrenia (%): Percentage of the population affected.

Bipolar disorder (%): Percentage of the population affected.

Anxiety disorders (%): Percentage of the population affected.

Depression (%): Percentage of the population affected.

Drug use disorders (%) and Alcohol use disorders (%): Substance-related mental health issues.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handled missing values by filling them with mean values where applicable.

Converted data types for numerical accuracy.

Removed duplicates to ensure clean and reliable analysis.

Standardized column formats for consistency in visualization.

Key Insights

Global Distribution of Mental Disorders

Some regions show significantly higher prevalence rates of anxiety and depression.

Developing countries tend to have lower reported cases, possibly due to underreporting.

Trends Over Time

Anxiety and depression rates have increased over the years, especially in high-income countries.

Some regions show improvements due to better mental health awareness and interventions.

Correlations Between Disorders

High correlation between depression and anxiety disorders.

Substance use disorders are often linked to other mental health conditions.

Top Affected Countries

Certain countries consistently report higher mental disorder prevalence, calling for targeted intervention strategies.

Tableau Dashboard Features
